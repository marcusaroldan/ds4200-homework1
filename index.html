    <h3> A little about me:</h3>
    <p>Hey there! Welcome to my peresonal website. I hope you enjoy your stay and peruse the content it has to offer. My name is Marcus Roldan, and I am a 21-year-old, fourth-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University. Essentially my whole life I have played soccer, and I've been a devout supporter of FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen since I was 9 years old!</p>
    <p>I've also been learning Spanish for many years now and (finally) have acheived a high degree of proficiency in the language; I can finally talk with many of my relatives who only speak Spanish. </p>
    <p>About two years ago I became fascinated by urban transit and last summer I got the amazing opportunity to travel to the Netherlands on Dialogue to learn about their amazing transportation and urban planning philosophy. I wish to combine my expertise in Computer Science with my passion for transportation, and have been working on projects that combine the two fields. You can find links to some of my projects in the nav-bar.</p>
    <p>I also love traveling and experiencing new cultures. On this website you can also find some galleries from my travels (which I hope to add to in the future!). Thank you for visiting and have an awesome day!</p>
    <h3>Places I have been:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Delft in the Netherlands</li>
        <li>Jamaica</li>
        <li>Puerto Rico</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/marcusaroldan">GitHub</a>!</h3>
    <h3>Coming Soon!</h3>

        <li>Interactive travel gallery</li>
        <li>Resume preview</li>
        <li>Navigation bar to other pages</li>
    </ul>
